    Helo is a simple Hello World application with various features to amuse the programmer. A list of these features will be provided, along with the in-depth methodology used. Finally, we will conclude and summarize the paper in brief, with some closing thoughts.
There isn't much to talk about for this one. It's a button that changes the text "hello world!" to the text "Button pressed!". It was fun to play around with Astudio however, and I believe I now understand the workflow much better. I'm sure there is a way to link everything with the GUI but discovering that I can use the .xml files in kotlin was much more intuitive for me.

\ParallelRText{

As you can see, the button changes the text displayed on the screen. Given that I have to learn about Kotlin in addition to learning the android API there isn't a lot of code right now. I also am experimenting with the Astudio suggestions to get a quick insight into a potential function without having to crawl through the API constantly.
The programmer actually spent most of the total time spent working on the project in LaTeX fiddling with figures and formatting text for this document.
